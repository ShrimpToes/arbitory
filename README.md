## Arbitory
   A game that is currently in development. The idea is to have an open world fps based around automation and capturing/defending areas of resource production. If you can 3d model, think up game design, or code, feel free to ask [@Squid](https://github.com/ShrimpToes) or [@Eldeston](https://github.com/Eldeston) what you can do.
